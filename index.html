    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/nitzel/fritzbox-missed-calls-telegram-bot">fritzbox-missed-calls-telegram-bot</a> will inform you about (fixed-line/land line) calls you missed via the <a href="https://telegram.org/">telegram-messenger</a> by polling your AVM FritzBox (router that also handles telephony).
      If available, it also displays the name associated with the phone number so that you know who tried to call you - without even beeing at home. The name comes from a configurable dictionary and by checking several websites that allow reverse lookups of phone numbers.
